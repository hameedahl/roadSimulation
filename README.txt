## PURPOSE
        > Creates a window with a canvas containing the background, the player
          (the bike), other types of vehicles needed for the simulation, and a 
          control panel at the bottom which can be used to control components 
          in the scene.

## USAGE
        > Compile with `javac Background.java Controls.java Model.java 
                        SimControls.java Bike.java DropDown.java 
                        PlayerButton.java Slider.java Canvas.java Main.java
                        PlayerControls.java Spinner.java Car.java MenuBar.java
                        SimButton.java Vehicle.java`
        > Run with `java Main`

## RULES OF SIMULATION
        > users can drive and change the speed and bike color
        > add new vehicles to the simulation by picking a car, lane, and
          initial speed, then hit "add vehicle"

## OBJECTS, INHERITANCES, AND HIERARCHY
        > Main (JFrame)

                                        > Background (owned by Model)
                                > Slider (JSlider)
                                > DropDown (JComboBox)
