## PURPOSE
        > Creates a window with a canvas containing the background and bike 
          needed for the simulation, a control panel at the bottom which
          will be used to control components in the scene, and a menubar 
          (no functionality at the moment).

## USAGE
        > Compile with `javac Main.java Bike.java Button.java Canvas.java 
                        Controls.java MenuBar.java`
        > Run with `java Main`

## RULES OF SIMULATION
        > At the moment, there aren't any rules, users can drive and change 
          the speed and bike color

## OBJECTS, INHERITANCES, AND HIERARCHY
        > Main (JFrame)
                > Canvas (JPanel)
                        > Bike 
                > Controls (JPanel)
                        > Button (JButton)
                                > Bike (owned by Canvas)
